# College GPA Calculator
### This calculator is designed to calculate your GPA by specifying your current GPA in a letter, percentage, or grade for one semester or more. It will also give you your grade as Letter Grade, percentage, and estimate.
Grade point average (GPA) is a commonly used indicator of an individual's academic achievement in school. It is the average of the grades attained in each course, taking course credit into consideration. Grading systems vary in different countries or even schools. This calculator accepts letter grades as well as numerical inputs. These letter grades are translated into numerical values as shown below.
| Letter Grade | Point Value |
| :----------: | :---------: |
|      A+      |     4.0     |
|      A       |     3.8     |
|      A-      |     3.6     |
|      B+      |     3.4     |
|      B       |     3.2     |
|      B-      |     3.0     |
|      C+      |     2.8     |
|      C       |     2.6     |
|      C-      |     2.4     |
|      D+      |     2.2     |
|      D       |     2.0     |
|      F       |      0      |

The values may vary slightly with different countries or colleges, so you can enter the **point values** you want instead of Letter Grade, and you can enter **percentages** instead of all that ü§ç
